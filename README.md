A readme is much more than plain text, a readme is what visitors first observe in a repository, so we must have a little attention when creating it so we can capture the attention of visitors, in addition to being colorful it will cause a good impression, and will give confidence.
Which suggests that the code is more likely to have attention to detail and maintenance.

Now let's start by knowing a little about what **md** is. md or **marckdown**, what it is and what it is for.

### What is Markdown

Markdown is an easy way to add formatting to web texts. With format we refer to italics, bold, lists, and more, in plain text - for example, the text that we find in the HTML viewer of blog editors, or in Windows Notepad, to make the concept more affordable-. Markdown was originally created by **John Gruber**, with the help of **Aaron Swartz**, with the purpose of creating a plain text that is easy to write and easy to read, and that could be easily and validly converted to XHTML.

### What is it for
Now that we've talked about what Markdown is, we have to see what it's for. The emphasis we will put is clearly web, but there are other things that can be done with Markdown. For example, to-do lists.

> ## Structure of a readme

### Introduction
In this section we must offer a summary of what the project consists of, that is, we must give a summary, clear and concise idea of what the project consists of.
Â 
### Project information
Here we must offer the technical status information of the project. The version it is in, the bugs, the latest build, the technologies used, etc.

### Documentation
This is the most important part. This is where we must specify everything we must do to launch the project. What files to download, how to build the database if needed, configuration of startup paths, etc.

### Extra information
In this section we must add additional information that users can use to clarify details that they have not understood in the rest of the readme or contact information such as social networks, email, etc.

> ## Basic writing and formatting syntax

### Headings
To create a heading, add one to six **#** symbols before your heading text. The number of **#** you use will determine the size of the heading.

```
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading

```
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading

### Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text.
